Please follow these steps to complete your review:

You are not required to attach the document.




Important

Although the review email will appear to be from the Contracts Analyst (agreement owner) or Proposal Developer that is managing your contract, it is actually masking a CLM system account email address. Hit reply and the CLM address in the To: line will become unmasked (CLM_O365_Agreement_Reviews@iqvia.com). Please leave this as it is.
If PL approval applicable, Project Leads will need to reply as outlined above, but also complete and attach the PL checklist upon approving of the contract document.
The Contracts Analyst or Proposal Developer that is managing your contract must be entered into the cc: line of your email while replying on review email.
Review comments can be added into the body of the response email but when approving the contract please clearly state this (e.g. “This is approved” etc.).



Thank you</textOnly>
